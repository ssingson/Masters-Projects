# Stroke Prediction Data Mining Project

## Overview
This project is a data mining analysis for predicting stroke occurrences based on healthcare data. The dataset contains various health indicators, and the goal is to train machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a stroke. This project was conducted as a final project for a graduate course at Fordham University.

## Dataset
- The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).
- Dataset summary: 
  - Has patient information with medical and demographic features of the patient
  - ID - column differentiates each patient
  - Stroke - column the models will try to predict 
## Requirements
- The only requirement is **Jupyter Notebook**.
- No additional dependencies need to be installed beyond standard libraries available in Python.
- Packages used: 
  - imblearn
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - sklearnx 

## Running the Notebook
1. Open Jupyter Notebook.
2. Load the provided notebook.
3. Update the dataset path in the notebook to the correct file path where the dataset is saved on their computer:
  ```python
  pd.read_csv('C:/Users/seths/Desktop/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv')
4. Run the notebook **one cell at a time** to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

## Key Features
- **Preprocessing:** Handles categorical variables, standardizes numerical features, and fills missing values (BMI).
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Decision Trees
  - Ensemble Methods
  - Linear Models
  - Na√Øve Bayes
  - Neural Networks
- **Model Evaluation:**
  - ROC-AUC Score
  - Precision-Recall Curve
  - ROC Curve


## Results
- The project evaluates model effectiveness and compares predictions with actual stroke occurrences.
  - The best-trained model achieved an **80% true positive rate** with a **25% false positive rate**.
  - Performance was **0.55 lower than random guessing**.
- Charts and comparison results between **training and test data** are included.
