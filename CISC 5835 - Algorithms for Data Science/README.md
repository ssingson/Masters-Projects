# Community Detection for Social Media Networks

## Overview
This project explores **community detection in social media networks** using graph algorithms. The approach involves constructing **graph representations of networks** (where vertices represent users and edges represent their interactions) and applying **edge-scoring techniques** to identify weak connections. By removing these edges, we uncover tightly connected communities.

The project is based on the **Girvan-Newman Algorithm and Edge Betweenness Centrality** and applies **Python-based graph structures** to detect communities. A key application of this methodology is in **social media marketing**, where advertisers can identify "look-alike audiences" to improve customer targeting.

## Dataset
This project does not use a pre-existing dataset but instead constructs graphs dynamically. However, it can be adapted to **real-world social media network data**.

## Requirements
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive exploration)
- Required libraries:
  - `networkx`
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib` (for visualizing graphs)

## Running the Project
1. **Setup Environment:** Install the required Python libraries.
2. **Graph Construction:** Define a **graph structure** where:
   - **Vertices** represent users.
   - **Edges** represent relationships (e.g., friendships, follows).
3. **Community Detection:**
   - Compute **edge scores** to determine weak links.
   - Remove high-scoring edges iteratively.
   - Identify separate **communities** in the graph.
4. **Analyze Results:**
   - Output **community sizes** and their members.
   - Identify **look-alike audiences** for marketing applications.

## Key Features
- **Graph Representation:**
  - Implements `Vertex`, `Edge`, and `Graph` classes in Python.
- **Edge Scoring Algorithms:**
  - Uses **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to explore graph structure.
  - Assigns **vertex and edge scores** based on shortest paths.
- **Community Detection:**
  - Removes high-scoring edges to reveal **natural clusters**.
- **Marketing Use Case - Look-Alike Audiences:**
  - Identifies potential new customers based on **community similarities**.
  - Optimized targeting for **social media ads**.

## Results
- The community detection algorithm successfully identifies **highly connected groups** in a network.
- Marketers can leverage these clusters for **targeted advertising** and **personalized experiences**.
- Social media networks can refine **audience segmentation** for enhanced user engagement.

## Applications
- **Social Media Networks:** Improve user engagement by clustering similar users.
- **Marketing & Advertising:** Identify untapped customer segments.
- **Network Security:** Detect anomalous user behavior in online communities.
